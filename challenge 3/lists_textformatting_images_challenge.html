    <h2>Directions</h2>
      <strong><em>Peel</strong></em> the onion, then finely chop with the carrot and celery.
      Place a large pan on a <strong><em>medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons</strong></em> of olive oil and squeeze the sausagemeat out of
      the skins into the pan, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go.<strong><em>Fry for a few minutes</strong></em>, then add the
      fennel seeds, oregano and chilli flakes, and strip in the rosemary. <strong><em>Finely chop</strong></em> and add the basil stalks,
      reserving the leaves for later.<strong><em>Add the chopped veg</strong></em>, then <strong><em>peel and finely grate</strong></em>
      in the garlic.<strong><em> Cook for 10 minutes</strong></em>, or until softened. Pour over the balsamic vinegar and <strong><em>leave
      to bubble away</strong></em> and reduce slightly. <strong><em>Scrunch in the tomatoes</strong></em> through your clean hands, then add
      1 tinâ€™s worth of water and the larger basil leaves. Bring to the boil, then simmer over a <strong><em>low heat for 20 minutes</strong></em>,
      or until thickened. With around <strong><em>10 minutes</strong></em> to go, cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to
      the packet instructions, then drain, reserving a mugful of cooking water. Toss the drained pasta into the sausage pan, loosening with a
      little reserved cooking water, if needed. Taste and season to perfection, then remove from the heat.<strong><em>Finely grate in the Parmesan</strong></em>,
      scatter over the remaining basil leaves, and finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Delicious served with pinches of lemony rocket and an
      extra grating of Parmesan, if you like.
