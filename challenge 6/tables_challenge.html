    <strong><u>Specific Situations In Which Tables Are Routinely Used:</strong></u>
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>A table of contents</em>, usually headed simply Contents and abbreviated informally as TOC, is a list, usually found on
    <br>a page before the start of a written work, of its chapter or section titles or brief descriptions with their commencing
    <br>page numbers.Usually it includes the titles or descriptions of the first-level headers, such as chapter titles in longer
    <br>works,and often includes second-level or section titles within the chapters as well, and occasionally even third-level
    <br>titles.The depth of detail in tables of contents depends on the length of the work, with longer works having less.
    <br>Formal reports (ten or more pages and being too long to put into a memo or letter) also have a table of contents.
    <br>Within an English-language book, the table of contents usually appears after the title page, copyright notices, and,
    <br>in technical journals, the abstract; and before any lists of tables or figures, the foreword, and the preface.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Mathematical tables</em> are lists of numbers showing the results of calculation with varying arguments, before calculators
    <br>were cheap and plentiful, people would use such tables to simplify and drastically speed up computation. Tables of
    <br>logarithms and trigonometric functions were common in math and science textbooks. Specialized tables were published
    <br>for applications such as astronomy, celestial navigation and statistics.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>The periodic table</em> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements, ordered by their atomic number, electron configuration,
    <br>and recurring chemical properties, whose adopted structure shows periodic trends. Generally, within one row (period) the
    <br>elements are metals on the left, and non-metals on the right, with the elements having similar chemical behaviours being
    <br>placed in the same column. Table rows are called periods. Columns are called groups. Six groups have accepted names
    <br>as well as assigned numbers: for example, group 17 elements are halogens; and group 18 are noble gases. Also displayed
    <br>are four simple rectangular areas or blocks associated with the filling of different atomic orbitals.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Database systems</em> often store data in structures called tables; in which columns are data fields and rows represent data records.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Modern software applications</em> give users the ability to generate, format, and edit tables and tabular data for a wide
    <br>variety of uses, for example:
    <ul>
      <li>word processing applications</li>
      <li>spreadsheet applications</li>
      <li>presentation software</li>
      <li>tables specified in HTML or another markup language</li>
    </ul>
