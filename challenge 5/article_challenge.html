      <h1>Silicon Valley Won’t Save Your Kids From Tech Addiction</h1>
        <p>
          We asked hundreds of parents how they manage(and don’t manage) their kids’ screen<br>
     time. The answers were candid, scary–and sometimes hopeful.

          “I am tethered to my smartphone for both work and entertainment, as is
          <br> my husband. It’s omnipresent and an extension of our bodies.No wanting
          <br>to be left out, my 16-month-old son takes the baby monitor, holds it in his
          <br>hands, and peers at it like it is a smartphone. It is the cutest/most pathetic
          <br>thing.”
        </p>

        <p>
            That’s the eerie image a New York mom of two paints of her small child’s
            <br>burgeoning tech addiction. Like most parents, that mom lives a waking life
            <br>seeped in almost non-stop screen time (an average American adult spends
            <br>about<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/30/health/americans-screen-time-nielsen/index.html">11 hours a day looking at a screen</a>).
            She, like many modern parents,
            <br>sees her own tech dependency reflected in her children’s habits. She doesn’t
            <br> always like what she sees.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Even as we learn about the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40520843/silicon-valley-technology-regulate-gadgets-and-apps-like-cigarettes">
          potential pitfalls</a> of our increasingly technology-
          <br>addled lifestyles, our dependence on tech shows little sign of waning. Still,
          <br>the anti-screen time drumbeat is getting louder, especially when it comes to
          <br>kids.
        </p>

        <p>
          In November, Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist who was an early
          <br>employee at Facebook, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40506058/former-facebook-exec-social-media-is-ripping-apart-society">
          said that the social network was “ripping apart the
          <br>social fabric of how society works.”</a> Tristan Harris, a former product
          <br> manager at Google,<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/our-minds-have-been-hijacked-by-our-phones-tristan-harris-wants-to-rescue-them/">told <em>Wired</em></a>
            that Apple, Google, Facebook, Snapchat,
          <br>Twitter, and Instagram design products to “hijack” our time and attention.
          <br>In January, two Apple investors asked the company to study the health
          <br>effects of its products on children.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then, last month, an unprecedented alliance of former employees from
          <br>some the most powerful tech companies–including Apple, Google, and
          <br>Facebook–formed the<a href="http://humanetech.com/"> Center for Humane Technology</a>. In partnership with
          <br>the nonprofit media watchdog group Common Sense Media, the group <br>plans to lobby against addictive tech, and is kicking off with<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40526553/truth-about-tech-campaign-aims-to-pressure-tech-giants-to-make-less-addictive-products">
          a $7 million
          <br> “Truth about Tech” ad campaign</a> that they plan to deliver to 55,000 public
          <br>schools

          How Our Tech Addiction–And Constant Distraction–Is A<br> Solvable Design Problem</a>
            <hr align="left" width="100%">
        </p>

        <p>
          That the very people who championed the technology to which we are
          <br>addicted are now banding together to warn parents about the monster
          <br>they’ve created is perhaps a sign that more people are starting to question
          <br>tech’s outsized role in our lives. But it feels a bit farfetched that an ad
          <br>campaign, no matter how well-intentioned, can really help curtail our
          <br>society’s addiction–especially when kids these days are being introduced to
          <br>screens at such a young age. In her book,<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Screen-Time-Balance-Digital/dp/1610396723"><em>The Art of Screen Time Anya</em></a>
          <br>Kamenetz cited a 2011 survey of 9,000 preschoolers (3- to 5-year-olds) that
          <br>found that young kids spend about four hours a day in the company of (all
          <br>types of) screens.
        </p>

      <p>
        To find out what parents think about their kids’ use of tech, Fast
        <br>Company surveyed nearly 400 parents. We tried to look at the issue from
        <br>all angles, from the amount of screen time kids get to have, to the types of
        <br>devices kids use, to parents’ regrets about their kids use of technology, to
        <br>the benefits that technology can provide to families. We also asked parents
        <br>how they feel about witnessing their own tech addiction reflected in their
        <br>kids’ behavior. Those were, perhaps, the most telling answers of all.
      </p>

      <p>
        The parents who answered our survey hail from all over the U.S. (and a few
        <br>other countries). Their professions span many industries, including
        <br>marketing, public relations, education, finance, therapy, video production,
        <br>law, medicine, and business. Most participants have one or two children,
        <br>ranging from 7 months to 18 years old. The majority of participants’ kids
        <br>are between 3 and 11 years old; in other words, these parents are in the
        <br>thick of parenting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Obviously, this self-selected group of Fast Company readers isn’t a
        <br>conclusive sample–but, along with expert research, these parents’ insights
        <br>help provide a snapshot of the worries that burden parents in our tech-
        <br>dependent era.

      <h2>DO SCREENS MAKE KIDS LESS SOCIAL AND LESS CREATIVE?</h2>
        <p>
          Even if it involves lots of virtual interaction via social networks and texting,
          <br>using a screen can be a pretty solo activity. Using smartphones, tablets, and
          <br>even computers aren’t generally as communal as watching a TV with your
          <br>family.
